#
# By default Odyssey does not run as a daemon. Set to 'yes' to enable.
#
daemonize no

#
# Process priority.
#
# Set Odyssey parent process and threads priority.
#
# priority -10

#
# Pid file.
#
# If pid_file is specified, Odyssey will write its process id to
# the specified file at startup.
#
# pid_file "/var/run/odyssey.pid"
#

#
# UNIX socket directory.
#
# If unix_socket_dir is specified, Odyssey will enable UNIX socket
# communications. Specified directory path will be used for
# searching socket files.

###
### LOGGING
###

#
# Log file.
#
# If log_file is specified, Odyssey will additionally use it to write
# log events.
#
# log_file "/var/log/odyssey.log"
#

#
# Log text format.
#
# Odyssey allows to configure log text format. This could be useful to
# support external log parser format. Format string can contain plain
# text, escape symbols and format flags.
#
# Supported flags:
#
# %n = unixtime
# %t = timestamp with date
# %p = process ID
# %i = client ID
# %s = server ID
# %u = user name
# %d = database name
# %c = context
# %l = level (error, warning, debug)
# %m = message
# %M = message tskv
# %r = client port
# %h = client host
#
log_format "%p %t %l [%i %s] (%c) %m\n"

#
# Log to stdout.
#
# Set to 'yes' if you need to additionally display log output in stdout.
# Enabled by default.
#
log_to_stdout yes

#
# Log to system logger.
#
# To enable syslog(3) usage, set log_syslog to 'yes'. Additionally set
# log_syslog_ident and log_syslog_facility.
#
log_syslog no
log_syslog_ident "odyssey"
log_syslog_facility "daemon"

#
# Verbose logging.
#
# Enable verbose logging of all events, which will generate a log of
# detailed information useful for development or testing.
#
# It is also possible to enable verbose logging for specific users
# (see routes section).
#
log_debug no

#
# Log configuration.
#
# Write configuration to the log during start and config reload.
#
log_config yes

#
# Log session events.
#
# Write client connect and disconnect events to the log.
#
log_session yes

#
# Log client queries.
#
# Write client queries text to the log. Disabled by default.
#
log_query no

#
# Log client statistics.
#
# Periodically display information about active routes.
#
log_stats yes

#
# Statistics update inverval.
#
# Set interval in seconds for internal statistics update and log report.
#
stats_interval 60

#
# Log stats in Prometheus format.
#
# Write stats in Prometheus format in addition to ordinary logs.
#
log_stats_prom no

###
### PERFORMANCE
###

#
# Worker threads.
#
# Set size of thread pool used for client processing.
#
#  1: By default, Odyssey runs with a single worker. This is a special
#  mode optimized for general use. This mode also made to reduce multi-thread
#  communication overhead.
#
#  N: Add additional worker threads, if your server experience heavy load,
#  especially using TLS setup.
#
workers 1

#
# Resolver threads.
#
# Number of threads used for DNS resolving. This value can be increased, if
# your server experience a big number of connecting clients.
#
resolvers 1

#
# IO Readahead.
#
# Set size of per-connection buffer used for io readahead operations.
#
readahead 8192

#
# Coroutine cache size.
#
# Set pool size of free coroutines cache. It is a good idea to set
# this value to a sum of max clients plus server connections. Please note, that
# each coroutine consumes around `coroutine_stack_size` of memory.
#
# Set to zero, to disable coroutine cache.
#
cache_coroutine 0

#
# Coroutine stack size.
#
# Set coroutine stack size in pages. In some rare cases
# it might be necessary to make stack size bigger. Actual stack will be
# allocated as (`coroutine_stack_size` + 1_guard_page) * page_size.
# Guard page is used to track stack overflows.
#
# 16KB by default.
#
coroutine_stack_size 8

#
# TCP nodelay.
#
# Set to 'yes', to enable nodelay.
#
nodelay yes

#
# TCP keepalive time.
#
# Set to zero, to disable keepalive.
#
keepalive 15

#
# TCP keepalive interval
#

keepalive_keep_interval 75

#
# TCP keepalive probes
#

keepalive_probes 9

#
# TCP user timeout
#
keepalive_usr_timeout 0

###
### GLOBAL LIMITS
###

#
# Global limit of client connections.
#
# Comment 'client_max' to disable the limit. On client limit reach, Odyssey will
# reply with 'too many connections'.
#
# client_max 100

#
# Global limit of client connections concurrently being routed.
# Client connection is being routed after it is accepted and until it's startup
# message is read and connection is assigned route to the database. Most of the
# routing time is occupied with TLS handshake.
#
# Unset or zero 'client_max_routing' will set it's value equal to 16 * workers
#
# client_max_routing 32

#
# If server responds with "Too many clients" client will wait for server_login_retry milliseconds.
#
# server_login_retry
#
# 1 by default.

###
### LISTEN
###

#
# Listen section defines listening servers used for accepting
# incoming client connections.
#
# It is possible to define several Listen sections. Odyssey will listen on
# every specified address port and can use separate TLS settings.
#
# Odyssey will fail in case it could not bind on any resolved address.
#

listen {
#
# 	Bind address.
#
#	If host is not set, Odyssey will try to listen using UNIX socket if
#	unix_socket_dir is set.
#
	host "*"
#
#	Listen port.
	port 6432
#
#	TCP listen backlog.
	backlog 128
#
#	TLS support.
#
#	Supported TLS modes:
#
#	"disable"     - disable TLS protocol
#	"allow"       - switch to TLS protocol on request
#	"require"     - TLS clients only
#	"verify_ca"   - require valid client certificate
#	"verify_full" - require valid client certificate
#
#	tls "disable"
#	tls_ca_file ""
#	tls_key_file ""
#	tls_cert_file ""
#	tls_protocols ""

#
#   Support of PostgreSQL protocol compression (experimental). Set to 'yes' to enable, disabled by default.
#
    compression no

#   client_login_timeout
#   Prevent client stall during routing for more that client_login_timeout milliseconds.
#   Defaults to 15000.
}

###
### ROUTING
###

#
# Odyssey allows to define client routing rules by specifying
# 'database', 'user' and 'storage' sections.
#
# On client accept appropriate route is assigned by matching 'database' and
# 'user' sections, all requests then forwarded to a 'storage'
# (which is referenced from the 'user' section).
#
# Database <name> | default.
#
# Defines database name requested by client. Each 'database' section structure
# consist of a 'user' subsections.
#
# A special 'database default' is used, in case when no database is matched.
#
# User <name> | default.
#
# Defines authentication, pooling and storage settings for
# requested route.
#
# A special 'user default' is used, in case when no user is matched.
#
# Storage <name>.
#
# Defines server used as a data storage or admin console operations.
#

storage "postgres_server" {
#
#	Storage type.
#
#	"remote" - PostgreSQL server
#	"local"  - Odyssey (admin console)
#
	type "remote"
#
#	Remote server address.
#
#	If host is not set, Odyssey will try to connect using UNIX socket if
#	unix_socket_dir is set.
#
	host "localhost"

#	tls_ca_file ""
#	tls_key_file ""
#	tls_cert_file ""
#	tls_protocols ""

#
#	Global limit of server connections concurrently being routed.
#	We are opening no more than server_max_routing server connections concurrently.
#
#	Unset or zero 'server_max_routing' will set it's value equal to number of workers
#
#	server_max_routing 4

#
#		Remote server to use.
#
#		By default route database and user names are used as connection
#		parameters to remote server. It is possible to override this values

#		password_passthrough "yes"
#		By default odyssey authenticate users itself, but if side auth application is used,
#		like LDAP server, PAM module, or custom auth module, sometimes, 
#		instead of configuring storage_password, it is more convenient to reuse
#		client-provided password to perform backend auth. If you set this option to "yes"
#		Odyssey will store client token and use when new server connection is Opened. Anyway, if
#		you configure storage_password for route, password_passthrough is essentially ignored

#
#		Execute 'ROLLBACK' if server left in active transaction.
#		Close connection otherwise.
