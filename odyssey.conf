### SERVICE
###

#
# Start as a daemon.
#
# By default Odyssey does not run as a daemon. Set to 'yes' to enable.
#

###
### LOGGING
###

#
# Log file.
#
# If log_file is specified, Odyssey will additionally use it to write
# log events.
#
# log_file "/var/log/odyssey.log"
#

#
# Log text format.
#
# Odyssey allows to configure log text format. This could be useful to
# support external log parser format. Format string can contain plain
# text, escape symbols and format flags.
#
# Supported flags:
#
# %n = unixtime
# %t = timestamp with date
# %p = process ID
# %i = client ID
# %s = server ID
# %u = user name
# %d = database name
# %c = context
# %l = level (error, warning, debug)
# %m = message
# %M = message tskv
# %r = client port
# %h = client host
#
log_format "%p %t %l [%i %s] (%c) %m\n"

#
# Log to stdout.
#
# Set to 'yes' if you need to additionally display log output in stdout.
# Enabled by default.
#
log_to_stdout yes

#
# Log to system logger.
#
# To enable syslog(3) usage, set log_syslog to 'yes'. Additionally set
# log_syslog_ident and log_syslog_facility.
#
log_syslog no
log_syslog_ident "odyssey"
log_syslog_facility "daemon"

#
# Verbose logging.
#
# Enable verbose logging of all events, which will generate a log of
# detailed information useful for development or testing.
#
# It is also possible to enable verbose logging for specific users
# (see routes section).
#
log_debug no

#
# Log configuration.
#
# Write configuration to the log during start and config reload.
#
log_config yes

#
# Log session events.
#
# Write client connect and disconnect events to the log.
#
log_session yes

#
# Log client queries.
#
# Write client queries text to the log. Disabled by default.
#
log_query no

#
# Log client statistics.
#
# Periodically display information about active routes.
#
log_stats yes

#
# Statistics update inverval.
#
# Set interval in seconds for internal statistics update and log report.
#
stats_interval 3

###
### PERFORMANCE
###

#
# Worker threads.
#
# Set size of thread pool used for client processing.
#
#  1: By default, Odyssey runs with a single worker. This is a special
#  mode optimized for general use. This mode also made to reduce multi-thread
#  communication overhead.
#
#  N: Add additional worker threads, if your server experience heavy load,
#  especially using TLS setup.
#
workers 1

#
# Resolver threads.
#
# Number of threads used for DNS resolving. This value can be increased, if
# your server experience a big number of connecting clients.
#
resolvers 1

#
# IO Readahead.
#
# Set size of per-connection buffer used for io readahead operations.
#
readahead 8192

#
# Pipelining.
#
# Set size of buffer used for pipelining io operations between client
# and server. Odyssey will try to read as much as 'pipeline' data before sending
# data to a peer.
#
# This option differs from 'readahead' since it works with full PostgreSQL
# packets. Incoming packet can be larger than pipeline size, in that case buffer
# will be enlarged.
#
# It is a good idea to set this value to a approximate max size of
# data packet to reduce performance influence of a system memory allocator
# (like fragmentation, increased memory usage, etc).
#
pipeline 32768

#
# Pipeline pool cache size.
#
# Set size of pipeline cache pool (numbers). Approximate cache size could be
# calculated as 'cache' * 'pipeline'.
#
# Set to zero, to disable pipeline caching at all.
#
cache 100

#
# Pipeline buffer free watermark value.
#
# If pipeline buffer becomes bigger than `cache_chunk` free it, instead of
# putting back to cache.
#
# Set to zero, to disable the check.
#
cache_chunk 0

#
# Coroutine cache size.
#
# Set pool size of free coroutines cache. It is a good idea to set
# this value to a sum of max clients plus server connections. Please note, that
# each coroutine consumes around `coroutine_stack_size` of memory.
#
# Set to zero, to disable coroutine cache.
#
cache_coroutine 128

#
# Coroutine stack size.
#
# Set coroutine stack size in pages. In some rare cases
# it might be necessary to make stack size bigger. Actual stack will be
# allocated as (`coroutine_stack_size` + 1_guard_page) * page_size.
# Guard page is used to track stack overflows.
#
# 16KB by default.
#
coroutine_stack_size 4

#
# TCP nodelay.
#
# Set to 'yes', to enable nodelay.
#
nodelay yes

#
# TCP keepalive time.
#
# Set to zero, to disable keepalive.
#
keepalive 7200

###
### GLOBAL LIMITS
###

#
# Global limit of client connections.
#
# Comment 'client_max' to disable the limit. On client limit reach, Odyssey will
# reply with 'too many connections'.
#
# client_max 100

###
### LISTEN
###

#
# Listen section defines listening servers used for accepting
# incoming client connections.
#
# It is possible to define several Listen sections. Odyssey will listen on
# every specified address.
#
# Odyssey will fail in case it could not bind on any resolved address.
#

listen {
#
# 	Bind address.
	host "*"
#
#	Listen port.
	port 6432
#
#	TCP listen backlog.
	backlog 128
#
#	TLS support.
#
#	Supported TLS modes:
#
#	"disable"     - disable TLS protocol
#	"allow"       - switch to TLS protocol on request
#	"require"     - TLS clients only
#	"verify_ca"   - require valid client certificate
#	"verify_full" - require valid client ceritifcate
#
}

###
### ROUTING
###

#
# Odyssey allows to define client routing rules by specifying
# 'database', 'user' and 'storage' sections.
#
# On client accept appropriate route is assigned by matching 'database' and
# 'user' sections, all requests then forwarded to a 'storage'
# (which is referenced from the 'user' section).
#
# Database <name> | default.
#
# Defines database name requested by client. Each 'database' section structure
# consist of a 'user' subsections.
#
# A special 'database default' is used, in case when no database is matched.
#
# User <name> | default.
#
# Defines authentication, pooling and storage settings for
# requested route.
#
# A special 'user default' is used, in case when no user is matched.
#
# Storage <name>.
#
# Defines server used as a data storage or admin console operations.
#
