At first, you can create issues and your pr's in [Project page](https://github.com/yandex/odyssey).
We don't always respond quickly, but sometimes we do :)

Also we have a very friendly community [Telegram chat](https://t.me/+ecwqGEkVgXg2OTQy),
where you can ask any questions about Odyssey usage and developing.
