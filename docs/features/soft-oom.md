# Soft OOM support
*since 1.4.1*

Sometimes, even when using a connection pooler, you may encounter
Out Of Memory (OOM) situations on the PostgreSQL server. In such
cases, it is advisable to temporarily suspend accepting new connections
until PostgreSQLâ€™s memory consumption returns to a normal level.
To address this, we have implemented a "soft OOM" mechanism, which is
described in detail below. This mechanism helps prevent further
overloading the database by gracefully managing new connection attempts
during memory pressure events.

----

## Configuration

First of all you will need describe memory limitations in `soft-oom`
section at the root of [configuration](../configuration/overview.md):

```plaintext
soft_oom {
    process 'postgres'
    limit   750MB
}
```

After configured `soft_oom` section, you need to enable soft oom killer
in rules, there you want that feature to be enabled:

```plaintext

database "db" {
    user "user" {
        ...
        enable_soft_oom yes
    }
}
```

After that, all new connections to `db.user` will be answered by Odyssey
itself process described in `soft_oom` reached limit by total memory consumption:

```bash
psql 'host=localhost port=6432 user=postgres dbname=postgres sslmode=disable' -c 'select 42'
psql: error: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 6432 failed: Connection refused
	Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 6432 failed: FATAL:  odyssey: cbde8d0203caf: soft out of memory ('postgres' uses 157771776 bytes)
```
